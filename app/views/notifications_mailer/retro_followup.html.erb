      As you may know, on <%= @incident.started_at.to_date %>, we had incident <%= @incident.incident_id %> (<%= @incident.title %>). This incident will need a retrospective as soon as possible, at latest by <%= @incident.started_at.to_date+1.week %>. Please be sure to invite the IC to the retrospective meeting.<br>
    <p>
      A trello card and google doc have been created for tracking this retrospective:<br>
    </p>
      Trello Card: <%= @incident.trello_url %><br>
      Retrospective Notes Doc: <%= @incident.google_doc_url %><br>
    <p>
      <% if @incident.review %>
      This incident will need a public postmortem by <%= @incident.followup_on.to_date %>.
      <% end %>
